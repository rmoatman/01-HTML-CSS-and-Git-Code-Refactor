# 01-HTML-CSS-and-Git-Code-Refactor

## Description
The intent of this project was to gain experience refactoring existing code

- The owner of the website (A Marketing Agency):
    - Wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards
    - Wants the site to be optimized for search engines

## Application
- Using skills learned in weeks 1 and 2 of BootCamp, I refactored the site with the following results:
    - The site's links all function correctly
    - The CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure
    - Comments identifying structure, use, notes to designer, future considerations, and questions are included in both the index.html and style.CSS files

- Some specific changes included:
    - Removing `<div>` elements and replacing them with more appropriate descriptive elements
    - Consolidating and renaming CSS elements to improve organization and make them more descriptive--thus improving readability/usability
    - Adding comments to identify the layout of the site, its individual components, and the component styling
    - Adding tabindex attributes to define tab order
    - Adding descriptive alt attributes to images in the event the image can not be displayed or the user is using a screen reader
    - Adding a `<span>` element in the footer so the company name mirrors the logo in appearance
    - Identifying items for future consideration and development through comments

## Reflection
As mentioned above, the intent of this project was to gain experience refactoring existing code using the skills learned in weeks 1 and 2 of BootCamp.  It also allowed practice creating a repository, discussing code and with others in a study group, researching various topics (HTML/CSS usage, accessibility, semantic structure, and creating a useful README file).  My takeaways include:
-   The importance of taking time to review the code thoroughly before making changes
-   How to identify different sections of a website to allow for a systematic approach to code review and revision
-   The best practice of making changes incrementally
-   The usefulness of using descriptive class and id names
-   How tabindex can be used to aid navigation
-   How alt attributes can aid in conveying meaning
